    # When behind a loadbalancer and using mode_remoteip, the LogFormat
    # directives in apache2.conf also need to be changed.
    # All instances of %h should be changed to %a; the purpose of mode_remoteip
    # is to populate %a with whatever value is found in the RemoteIPHeader directive.
    # %h will have the IP of the loadbalancer.
    # TODO: Figure out how to override the LogFormat directives here so they
    # can be left alone in the base config. Naively replacing them here didn't seem to work.
